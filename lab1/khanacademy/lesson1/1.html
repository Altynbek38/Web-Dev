    <h1>Still I Rise</h1>
        <p>
        You may write me down in history<br>
        With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>
        You may trod me in the very dirt<br>
        But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>
        <br>
        Does my sassiness upset you?<br>
        Why are you beset with gloom?<br>
        Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>
        Pumping in my living room.
